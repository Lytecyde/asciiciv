##The Roadmap for the asciiciv Game

*0.01* graphical interface works, map has different terrains

*0.02* units movable on the map, movement depends on terrain

*0.03* cities can be built, cities generate economic output, cities build 
tools and buildings

*0.04* scientific advances both theories and technologies can 
be discovered, the mechanics being much more involved than
in the original. Theories can be forgotten. Techs remain 
until the tools they are embodied in, do not perish in use or 
by pillaging.

*0.05* Events include Fortunes in addition to Calamities, 
Civic policies may find their way in if there are requests for that.

*0.06* Governments:
Except for tyranny there are some laws specific to the government as well
as policies.

*0.07* final clean up and a bug fix version 



*0.1* **code is rewritten with tests!** a workable version with ascii graphics, no network yet
all units, terrains, science and resources function according to a 
ruleset, opponent moves randomly 

*0.2* a playable version with network support and a chat 
interface for enhancing diplomacy


*0.3* PC opponents(AI) guided by goals and moves with some learning
built in, diplomacy works with treaties and ultimatums and other features



**1.0** the game is fully playable and should be launched :) to space!
I would love to get this game played in orbit or on the way to Mars in 2024.


*1.2* moddability with text files in the rulesets 

**2.0** 2D graphics gets separate code and gets an isometric addition
unicode added to represent units etc in grid version of the map

*2.2* moddability for 2d graphics files 

**3.0** 3d graphics with the same game engine

*3.2* moddability for all graphics so far
