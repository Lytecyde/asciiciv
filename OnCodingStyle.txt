I am currently influenced by Clean Code by 'Uncle Bob' Robert C. Martin so this is a project primarily for investigating that
and developing myself in this style. 
Also many thanks to the webinars of Kevlin Henney, for Style and Formatting. 
Jules May for ifless programming advice, -- this has really created a fundamental change in my thinking, very grateful for that.
Also my personal discovery is that while ifless is always possible,  switchless is often possible and always desirable,  would 
use less code overall I think. And brevity is my highest aim, as long as fine granularity is not compromised.
This project will be rewritten at a later time on the basis of TDD once I have mastered the three 
Finally, I am also considering making this an exercise in Design by Coding. 
This code has bugs and it is not perfectly clean, just an experiment in coding and full-cycle product design.
