A project that aims to create a godsim for world history. There are some things I would like to explore in this project.
I think that to preserve trends that seem to appear in history like technological progress, advancement or liberty rationality 
and propsperity, we need to address the question of Extermination in 4X games. Therefore this is not a 4X game. I propose two 
new classes of games the 4D games and the ABCDE games that somewhat overlap. 

## A 4D Game
This is a game that rewards and concentrates on the application of 4 principles: 
1. Discovery - scientific discoveries and explorations by land, sea, air and space
2. Development - science, culture, spirit, commerce, diplomacy, civil policies and unit development
3. Design - make the world in your image, more effort and possibilities for creating the architecture and culture in the your
image, I would like to the player to be able to design in the player's own aesthetics.
4. Disarmament -  the game brings challenges from within the state and from outside the state of military nature, but 
these are considered problems to be tackled not means towards a success in the game.
This replaces extermination with demilitarisation that appears historically in comparison to the growth of population.

The object of the game corresponds to the 4Ds:
1. Make one of the ultimate discoveries, that would usher in the End of History
2. Excel all other players in achieving an overall supremacy in development, most likely involving all dimensions of development
3. Mod the game with your personal goal 
4. Bring a state of Peace on Earth to all beings. My personal favourite

A 4D game should be better for the spiritual wellbeing of the player, in comparison to the 4X game. If we get the design of this
concept right I think these games would provide more satisfaction to the young and old gamers than games based on heightened 
levels of testosterone and adrenaline.

## ABCDE Game
Arts
Business
Construction
Development
Education

Again the focus is on other concepts and this too is a genre of pacifist type games. Military units maybe completely removed 
from these games as playable options. Also the game has a dimension of Education which includes the two concepts of improvement
of units with new skills and crafts and wisdoms and knowledge, as well as the enlightenment of the population in schools.
ABCDE games maybe a subset of a 4D game.
ABCDE games should be more educational in comparison to 4X.
